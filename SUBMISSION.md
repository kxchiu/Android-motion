# Motion Game

The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### Give a 1-2 sentence explanation/pitch of your game! How would you "advertise" it on the Play Store (or similar storefront)? #####
> This game is intended to represent a beer pushing game in which the beer glass (yellow circle) should be flung and stay PERFECTLY behind the white line. The speed of the moving beer glass is affected by the screen's tilting angle, so it's actually not as easy as it seems!


##### Be sure and cite the sources for any visual or audio assets you used here! #####
> I use the audio assets from the lecture...the Star Wars. If you start or restart the game, you'll hear the light saber turns on. When you fling toward the white line, you'll hear 3 different saber swing audio on random, and when you fling away from the white line (which is restricted by ignoring the fling) you hear another different saber swing audio.


##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I tested my application on HTC M8 with target SDK of version 21 and minimum SDK of version 15.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent about 10-15 hours on this assignment.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Nope.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> It was actually kind of hard to think of a fun game to make...
